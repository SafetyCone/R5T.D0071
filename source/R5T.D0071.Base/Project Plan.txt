R5T.D0071.Base - Base service definitions library for the executing assembly file path provider service.

The ExecutingAssembly.IFilePathProvider will give you the DLL files location.

This is useful for getting the directory traditionally thought of as the "executable file" directory, but for use when code might be run by a tool (like in EF Core) or in testing (MSTest). In these cases, the entry-point assembly or executable file path as the first input argument are NOT the path you expect from running console apps.
